# Say The Same Thing

**Say the Same Thing** is a delightful and quirky game that lets you find out how alike (or not) you and your friends are.
Imagine this: you and a buddy are shown a random word and have 3 seconds to both think of the same _DIFFERENT_ word.

For example, you are shown the word "Forest". If both you and your friends say “Gump” you are on the same wavelength...
but if someone shouts "Trees!", well... you might want to kick that friend from your group 😂.
It’s a hilarious and creative way to get on the same wavelength as your buds.
The game is all about those “aha!” moments when you and your friends finally sync up and say the same thing.

Try playing this online version with a group and watch the laughter ensue.
